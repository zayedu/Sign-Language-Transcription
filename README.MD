- **High Accuracy**: Precision-tuned model for reliable recognition, essential for effective communication using ASL.
- **Modular and Scalable Design**: Easily expandable to include a wider array of ASL characters, supporting continuous growth and adaptability.

### Technologies Used

- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Pickle
- SciKit
- OpenCV

## Aligning with MLH Best DEI Hack Challenge

"SignSimplified" directly addresses the core themes of the MLH Best DEI Hack Challenge:

1. **Fostering Diversity and Inclusion**:

   - **Empowering the Deaf Community**: By improving access to communication for the deaf and hard of hearing, SignSimplified champions the cause of those who often face communication barriers.
   - **Cultural Inclusion**: ASL is a rich language with its own culture. Promoting its use and understanding brings us closer to a culturally diverse and inclusive society.

2. **Enhancing Equity**:

   - **Leveling the Playing Field**: By providing a tool that facilitates ASL communication, we're helping to ensure that individuals who communicate through ASL have equal access to interactions and information, be it in educational environments, social settings, or potentially, in financial and tech sectors.
   - **Addressing Educational Disparities**: SignSimplified can be an invaluable tool in educational settings, where deaf and hard of hearing students often face significant challenges due to lack of resources.

3. **Creating Sustainable and Inclusive Solutions**:
   - **Long-Term Impact**: The project's modular design ensures that it can grow and adapt, staying relevant and useful as a communication tool.
   - **Potential for Widespread Adoption**: By demonstrating the efficacy of ASL recognition technology, SignSimplified sets the stage for broader adoption in various sectors, increasing the overall impact on DEI initiatives.

## Future Directions

- **Integrating with Educational and Communication Platforms**: To make learning and information more accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing community.
- **Collaborative Expansion**: Inviting contributions to expand the ASL library, enhancing the tool's usefulness and reach.
